    <h1>What is Protocol Basics ??</h1>
    <p>HTTP is a protocol that is easy to learn the basics of. A client connects to a server—and it is always the client that takes the initiative—sends a request and receives a response. Both the request and the response consist of headers and a body. There can be little or a lot of information going in both directions.</p>
